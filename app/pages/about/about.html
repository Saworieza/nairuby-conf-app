      Ruby Conference brings entrepreneurs, developers, open source contributors, and conference speakers from all around the world for a 2-day conference. Why? We believe in a holistic approach we would solve so many problems through entrepreneurship approach “Solution approach” and open source approach. This in return empowers everyone who attends with technology “tool” and entrepreneurship “Methodology” to reach their fullest potential and inspire the rest of the world and their communities.

      Finding the complete solution for Africa will involve many different parties and many different techniques. Open source culture must be included in that toolkit to spur growth, innovation, and upliftment. By investigating their respective indicators in socio-economics, ICT penetration, and business environments, countries can determine which open source approach and practices suits them the best. Not every country will pursue the same open source and tool path, however, finding that best fit for each country’s need should be a critical area of focus for open source experts in the years to come.
